Flocker is a lightweight volume and container manager.
It lets you:

* Define your application as a set of connected Docker containers
* Deploy them to one or multiple hosts
* Easily migrate them along with their data between hosts

The goal of Flocker is to simplify the operational tasks that come along with running databases, key-value stores, queues and other data-backed services in containers.
This Getting Started guide will walk you step-by-step through installing Flocker and provide some tutorials that demonstrate the essential features of Flocker.
